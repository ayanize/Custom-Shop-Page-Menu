# Custom-Shop-Page-Menu

Create a new menu location and add a new menu. You can create a new menu and assign this to the new menu location. Refer to this image below.

Find the relevant functions in the functions.php file and copy and paste theme in your child theme functions.php file. Make sure you REMOVE the opening <?php that I have placed in this gist. If you child theme functions.php has already this php opening tag, you should not re-add this one.

Once you add them successfully, you will get the menu like the image below

Now copy the CSS I gave and make them look awesome.

Good luck. :)
